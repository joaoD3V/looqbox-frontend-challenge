## To-Do

- [ ] In the main page you need a search bar and a loaded list of pokemons (random or just hardcoded)
- [ ] Clicking on any pokemon shows a card/modal/page with that pokemon's info
- [ ] Searching and pressing enter on the search bar will show the result instead of the list
- [ ] Your app needs at least two different routes (/home /more for example -> be creative!)
